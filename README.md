## Goals
Up unitl this point I have learnt a lot of skills, so my goal for this project was to put it all together, for instance using Sass and react. This is also my first project where I have used react routing which I wanted to get more familiar with. 

## What I learnt 
1) Create react app with mulitple pages 


## Challanges I faced 
At first I had trouble gettting the routing to work, the reason for this was the recent changes, the newest version contains slightly different synatax to the previous, beacuse of this, a lot of tutorials on youtube or other websites were out of date.
