## The Project
This site showcases some of the projects I have already I have made and allows the viewer to view the code. It also has some contact details and some of my skills 

## Goals
Up unitl this point I have learnt a lot of skills, so my goal for this project was to put it all together, for instance using Sass and react. This is also my first project where I have used react routing which I wanted to get more familiar with.
